# hello-world
first repository
I'm a hobbyist programmer with experience in php, javascript, mysql, html, visual basic (but not for a while).
I started off programming a hc11 microcontroller when studying electronics.
now most of my programming is web based as I can use the same program on anything that has a web browser.
